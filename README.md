## Project Vision


### <div align="center"> What We Aims to Achieve </div>


Many beginners feel lost when they hear words like "polymorphism," "asynchronous," or "algorithms." ðŸ˜¬

We aim to create a simple solution: a lookup tool that helps them understand these terms, accessible anywhere, including offline.

The app maintains a local dictionary of common programming terms. If a user searches for a term that isnâ€™t available, the app will fetch it from an online dictionary, store it for future use, and to keep things lightweight, the words are saved in two separate files:

- One for pre-loaded common programming terms.
- One for words the user has viewed (cached).
